# CV-Cell-Disease-Detection
A project using CV and image segmentation to detect the presence of blood-borne diseases in blood smears of patients

Project by Hersh Godse to detect diseases such as sickle-cell anemia in patient blood smears, by analyzing the shape area and perimeter of red blood cells (RBC). The algorithm identifies both of these irregular cells, and counts all of the RBC present in the given blood smear image. The whole process of cell counting, detection, and classification takes around 3.4 seconds and works with high accuracy, at virtually no cost. I strongly believe this is and similar softwares will revolutionize medicine and healthcare.

For a more detailed explanation, look at the following document I wrote giving a step-by-step description of my algorithim:
